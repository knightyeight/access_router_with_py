# access_router_with_py
Useful to access the router login page


This specfic code is useful to open login page of the router to which we are connected assuming the default address "http://192.168.0.1" to access it.

If a different url is required to enter, that can be done by changing i.e, adding the required url, username and password in the source file.

Or that can be done using cmd as the script accepts just url or username or password or all of them combined.

To run the script using cmf use #python3 rtr.py (url, username , password) 

This code can be made better and needs modifications as it is just my first project.
